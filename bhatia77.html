<H2><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Brian Lara, in full Brian Charles Lara, (born May 2, 1969, Cantaro, Trinidad), West Indian cricketer, one of the sport’s most renowned contemporary player<br>s. The compact left-handed batsman is the record holder for most runs scored in an<br> innings in both Test (international) and first-class cricket.<br>One of a family of 11, a natural athlete, and a member of the national <br>under-(age)14 football (soccer) team, Lara was expected from an early age to be<br> the next great West Indian cricketer. He was first selected for the West Indies national<br> team in 1990 at age 21, but he did <br>not make his mark until 1994, when he broke the two most coveted batting records in cricket, scoring 375 runs <br>against England (besting Sir Garfield Sobers’s 36-year-old record) and 501 runs (not out) for <br>arwickshire, his English county team. In 2004 Lara then became the first player to retake the Test <br>atting record when his 400 runs (not out)<br> against England surpassed the 380 runs<br posted by Australian Matthew Hayden in 2003. <BR></P></B></H2>
