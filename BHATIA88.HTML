<H1><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Renowned as one of the most barbarous hitters of the cricket ball<BR> ever - he once swung a Brett Lee delivery past the Lord<BR> Tennyson school outside Oval! - Gayle dismissed footwork <BR>to a famous cricketing redundancy of his time, and along with<BR> other contemporary opening batsmen in <BR>Tillakaratne Dilshan, Virender Sehwag, and Brendon McCullum later, fashioned a batting era characterized <BR>by an unreal dependence on hand-eye coordination and breakneck run-scoring across formats.<BR> No wonder he became the first batsman to hit the first<BR> ball of a Test match for a six. And it's only fair that<BR> he beat Sehwag to become the fastest double centurion<BR> in ODIs, minting 215 off 147 in a World Cup game against Zimbabwe <BR>in Canberra, 2015.Twenty20 cricket seemingly picked Chris Gayle as its ambassador<BR>, for he scored the very first hundred in the format and now uncontestedly <BR>owns almost every record there is, including that <BR>of the most runs (now 10,000+), most hundreds, fastest hundred, and most fours and sixes.<BR></P></B></H1>
