<b><h1><P ALIGN="CENTER"> When Babar Azam notched up his 5th ODI ton against West Indies in his 25th innings in early 2017, he became the second <br>quickest after Quinton De Kock to score five ODI tons. His aggregate of 1306 runs after 25 knocks <br>tallied the highest, beating Jonathan Trott's numbers.  His three<br> consecutive ODI tons against the Windies in 2016 in the UAE were a<br> precursor to one glorious career that stares at us.Pakistan's search for a dependable number<br> 3 in the shorter formats has been an eternal one. Their batting stocks at the international level,<br> especially in the shorter formats have looked as bare as Old Mother<br> Hubbard's cupboard. The arrival of Babar onto the big scene however can't exactly<br> be termed as serendipity.Ever since he was drafted into the Pakistan <br>under-19 team for the 2010 World Cup as a fifteen year old, it seemed as if another raw talent has been<br> unleashed. However, some polishing resulted in another <br>under-19 World Cup campaign in 2012. This time he was <br>the skipper. Pakistan were knocked <br>out by eventual winners India but Babar had piled the runs to be the top run getter for his team..</p></h1></b>
